A simple README.md that clearly documents your lead generation system, including setup, n8n integration, and future extensibility:


# 🧲 Lead Generation System

This project is a simple lead generation system built using:
- **Frontend** (React)
- **Backend** (Node.js/Express)
- **Automation Workflow** using **n8n**
- **Hosting** via **Vercel** and **ngrok**

---

## 📌 Features

- User fills a lead form (name, email, company, message)
- Backend receives and validates the lead
- Lead data is forwarded to an **n8n webhook**
- You receive an email notification with lead details (via n8n)
- Leads are optionally saved in **Google Sheets** or a CRM

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository ### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lead-generation-system.git
cd lead-generation-system



### 2. Set up Backend //

cd lead-format-backend
npm install
Create a .env file in the root of the backend folder:

PORT=5000
N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://your-ngrok-or-n8n-public-url/webhook/lead
Start the backend:


npm start
You can also deploy it to Vercel:



vercel --prod
Replace the fetch URL in your frontend with your Vercel backend URL.

###  3. Setup Frontend

cd lead-format-frontend
npm install
npm start
Ensure the backend URL is correctly set in fetch():

js


await fetch('https://your-backend-url/api/leads', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
});



###   4. n8n Workflow Setup

Go to n8n.io or self-host it.

Create a new Webhook node with:

Method: POST

Path: lead → /webhook/lead

Connect further nodes:

Google Sheets (to store leads)

Email (to notify you)

Copy the webhook URL and use it in .env as N8N_WEBHOOK_URL.

Use ngrok to expose local n8n for testing:



ngrok http 5678
🔄 Workflow Integration
Here's how everything flows:

Frontend Form ➡️ Backend ➡️ n8n Webhook ➡️ Email Notification / Google Sheet / CRM
Backend forwards form data to n8n via webhook.

n8n handles automation (emailing, storing in sheets, etc.).

🚀 Future Extensions
Here are ways you can extend this system:

✅ Lead Qualification
Add logic in backend or n8n to filter based on email domain, company size, etc.

🤝 CRM Integration
Add HubSpot, Zoho, or Salesforce nodes in n8n.

📊 Admin Dashboard
Build a protected admin panel to view and manage leads (React + MongoDB).

🔐 Authentication
Add JWT-based auth to protect backend endpoints and dashboards.

📈 Analytics
Use n8n + external tools like Google Analytics or Vercel Analytics.

🧪 Test the Flow
Run frontend and backend (or deploy).

Submit a lead form.

Check:

Console logs for backend

n8n for workflow execution

Email or sheet for stored data
